            <h1><i>Book Review: Pride And Prejudice</i></h1>
            <p>This book is quite possibly the most insipid novel I have ever read in my life. I would rather read Twilight twelve more times than read this again. Why this book is so highly treasured by society is beyond me. It is 345 pages of nothing. The characters are like wispy shadows of something that could be interesting, the language that could be beautiful ends up becoming difficult to decipher and lead me more than once to skip over entire paragraphs because I became tired of having to stumble through them only to emerge unsatisfied, and the plot is non-existent, as though Austen one day decided she wanted to write a novel and began without having any idea what would happen except that there would be a boy and a girl who seemingly didn’t like each other but in the end got married. The story really probably could have been told in about 8 pages, but Austen makes us slog through 345 pages of mind-numbing balls and dinner-parties. I don’t care what anyone says, this is not great literature. This is a snore</p>
        <p>Each version gave a unique flavor to Austen's novel, while all being more or less faithful to it. None of them made major changes in the plot; it was the spin the actors gave the characters that made the difference more than any minor scene variations. From Edna May Oliver's snooty but kindly deep down Lady Catherine de Bourgh in 1940 to Judi Dench's scary death goddess in 2005, every character was recognizably Austen's, and yet none of them were exactly hers. It's quite an experience to watch the same story four times in a row played by an entirely different cast filmed in an entirely different era.</p>
